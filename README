INSTALLATION:

  All you need is the Objective Caml 3.02 (or greater) compiler and
standard Unix tools (make...).

  0) Configure the library. The single option of configuration is the
directory you want to put the library files in (facile.cma, facile.cmxa,
facile.a facile.cmi). Default is the subdirectory "facile" of the Ocaml
library directory (returned by "ocamlc -where").

	./configure [--faciledir <target directory>]

  1) First compile the library with a simple

        make

  2) Check the result

        make check

     You should get a solution for the 8 queens problem.

  3) Then install the library with a (usually as root)

        make install
